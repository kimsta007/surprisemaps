		<strong>Title of Research Study:</strong> Taken by Surprise? An evaluation of Bayesian Weighting for map visualization.<br/><br/>

		<strong>Introduction</strong><br/>
		
		You are being asked to participate in a research study.  Before you agree, however, you must be fully informed about the purpose of the study, the procedures to be followed, and any benefits, risks or discomfort that you may experience as a result of your participation.  This form presents information about the study so that you may make a fully informed decision regarding your participation. <br/><br/>

		<strong>Purpose of the study:</strong><br/>  Maps are an important tool for conceptualizing geo-spatial data and their application spans across numerous research disciplines. 
		Map visualizations are however, associated with a form of bias that is a result of varying population densities used for the calculation of event-rates. One plausible way of 
		overcoming such bias in map visualizations is through the use Surprise Maps! The purpose of this study is to evaluate how people interpret Surprise Maps.<br/><br/>

		<strong>Procedures to be followed:</strong><br/>  You will begin the experiment by conducting a few trials. You will be shown a data visualization, after which you will be asked to respond to a series of tasks.<br/><br/>

		<strong>Risks to study participants:</strong><br/>  Each participant in this study is assigned a random ID. As such, your participation will remain anonymous and your responses will not able to be used to identify you.<br/><br/>

		<strong>Benefits to research participants and others:</strong><br/>  The possible benefits include exposure to interesting data visualization techniques and topics, along with helping inform the development of future techniques.<br/><br/>
		 
		<strong>Record keeping and confidentiality:</strong> Records of your participation in this study will be held confidential so far as permitted by law. However, the study investigators, the sponsor or itâ€™s designee and, under certain circumstances, the Worcester Polytechnic Institute Institutional Review Board (WPI IRB) will be able to inspect and have access to this data.  Any publication or presentation of the data will not identify you. <br/>

		<strong>Cost/Payment: </strong> $1.00 (This study is estimated to take approximately _ hours.)<br/><br/>

		For more information about this research or about the rights of research participants, or in case of research-related injury, contact: Akim Ndlovu (contact info at the top of this page). In addition, you may contact the IRB Chair (Professor Kent Rissmiller, Tel. 508-831-5019, Email:  kjr@wpi.edu) and the University Compliance Officer (Jon Bartelson, Tel. 508-831-5725, Email:  jonb@wpi.edu). <br/><br/>

		Your participation in this research is voluntary.  Your refusal to participate will not result in any penalty to you or any loss of benefits to which you may otherwise be entitled.  You may decide to stop participating in the research at any time without penalty or loss of other benefits.  The project investigators retain the right to cancel or postpone the experimental procedures at any time they see fit. <br/><br/>
